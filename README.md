# AERONET-Brazil-

## Comparison between AERONET and MODIS sensor

* Here we are going to compare the in-situ data from several AERONET stations (point data) with the satellite data (in this case Terra and Aqua). 
* Therefore we are going to carry out some steps: 
### First, extract and read the AERONET data 
* 
### Second, extract and read the satellite data 
*
### Third, Compare both data (AERONET and Satellite)
*
### Finally, Analysis both data (AERONET and Satellite)
